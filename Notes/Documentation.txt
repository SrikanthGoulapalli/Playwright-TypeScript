Basics :

Node.js – 
Node.js is open source, cross platform, backend Javascript run time environment which runs on V8 engine and executes the JavaScript code outside a web browser

Command – npm int playwright
This will create a new node project in the playwright structure. This is a playwright skeleton required for automation. This command also installs all the dependencies. Run this command in Terminal section of Visual Studio Code


Terminal Commands :
npx playwright test  (to run all the tests sequentially configured in the config file in a headless mode)
npx playwright test  --headed (to run all the tests sequentially configured in the config file in a head (you will be able to see the actions in the browser) mode)
npx playwright show-report (To open last HTML report run)

TypeScript :

Diffrences between JavaScript and TypeScript

JavaScript - it is dynamically typed language
Typescript - it is statically typed language

Why Typescript ?
    Javascript is ECMAScript (ES3, ES4, ES5, ES6 (which is the latest)) complaince i.e. it follows all ECMAScript rules.
    Microsfot cannot add new features to JavaScript which doesn't complaince to ECMAScript. Hence it created Typescript.
    It can add any new features to TypeScript as long as it's generated JavaScript code is ECMAScript complaince.
